# PaceRace

Welcome to PaceRace, a student project to optimize the laptime of a 2D vehicle on randomly generated tracks based on reinforcement learning.

## Description

In Progress.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* csv
* gym
* json
* math
* matplotlib   
* numpy  
* os  
* pandas
* pickle
* pillow   
* random  
* scipy  
* shapely  
* stable_baselines3  
* tkinter  

For a Windows operating system, install the conda environment from folder ```condaEnv\```.

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/FinnLor/pace-race.git
```

### Executing program

* Use train.py to train an agent for a specified number of iterations
* GUI.py opens a GUI where you can load a SAC model and run it either on randomized tracks or on a track that you individually specify by width and path points

### Models
* Trained agents of a parameter study and a algorithm benchmarking study can be found in ```models\```.
