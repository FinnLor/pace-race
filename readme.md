# PaceRace

Welcome to PaceRace, a student project to optimize the laptime of a 2D vehicle on randomly generated tracks based on reinforcement learning. Work is in progess.

## Description

In Progress.

## Getting Started

* gym
* json
* math
* matplotlib   
* numpy  
* os  
* pandas

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/FinnLor/pace-race.git
```

### Executing program

All you need is in ```Env/```
* Use RL_pace_race.py to train an agent for a specified number of iterations
* UI_PaceIn.py opens a GUI where you can load a SAC model and run it either on randomized tracks or on a track that you individually specify by width and path points
