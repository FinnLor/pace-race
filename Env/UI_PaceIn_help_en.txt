Short Manual for the UI_PaceIn

This UI is used for an import and visualization of PaceRace agents 
and their behavior on different tracks. 
For this purpose a few options are available, which are briefly explained below.
An alphabetical list of the possible options is attached below.

First, two exemplary procedures are explained in chronological form:

Simplest variant:
Step 1: Load a model with 'Load Model'.
Step 2: Starting the rendering with 'Take Random Track'.

More complex variant:
Step 1: As above.
Optional steps: 
- Select the checkboxes 'Maintain car pos' and | or 'Plot performance'.
- Enter a road width (default: 24m) and apply it with 'Apply Width'.
- Enter a sequence of points in Canvas (without overlapping) and apply it with 'Apply Track'.
- If wished, delete a track with 'Clear Track' and optionally enter a new track.
- Start rendering with a randomly generated track 'Take Random Track' or 
  a manually generated track 'Take User Track'. 


Alphabetical, short overview of all options:

Apply Track (Button):
   Apply the road track displayed in the canvas as a center line.
Apply Width (Button):
   Apply the street width which is entered in the 'Entry Button'.
Clear Track (Button):
   Deletes the street track. This allows you to enter a new track.
Load Model (Button):
   Load an agent that was created with the SAC algorithm from 
   stable-baselines3.
   Note: Currently only SAC models can be loaded.
Maintain Car Pos (Checkbox):
   Selecting this checkbox causes all car positions to be visualized during rendering.
   are visualized.
More => Help (Menu Item):
   This short help.
More => About (Menu Item):
   Short info about the project.
Plot Performance (Checkbox):
   Additional output of the following diagrams during rendering:
   - Display of resultant forces 'F_res' over iterations 'Steps'.
   - Display of the normalized power 'P' value range: [-1:1] over the iterations 'Steps'.
   - Display of the cumulated reward 'SumRewards' over the iterations 'Steps'.
Quit (Menu Bar): 
   Quit UI_PaceIn.
RoadWidth (Entry Button):
   possibility to enter a road width as an integer, within the given range of values [8:40].
Take Random Track (Button):
   This starts a render episode with a randomly generated track and the loaded model.
Take User Track (Button):
   This starts a render episode with the manually generated track and the loaded model.
